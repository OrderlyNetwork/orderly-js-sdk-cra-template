# Template for Orderly SDK v2 based on Create React App

> **⚠️ Deprecated**  
> [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) was one of the key tools for getting a React project up-and-running in 2017-2021, it is now in long-term stasis and we recommend that you migrate to one of React frameworks documented on Start a New React Project.
>
> **We recommend using [orderly-js-sdk-vite-template](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/orderly-js-sdk-vite-template) instead for new projects.**
